### Demo


A real-time code editor is an interactive web application that allows multiple users to collaborate on code editing simultaneously. With the power of React, Node.js, and Socket.IO, developers can create a seamless and collaborative coding experience.

The frontend of the real-time code editor will be built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React's component-based architecture makes it easy to create reusable UI elements and manage application state efficiently. The React frontend will be responsible for rendering the code editor interface, handling user input, and communicating with the server through Socket.IO.

The core component of the frontend will be the code editor itself. Using libraries like "CodeMirror" developers can implement a feature-rich text editor with syntax highlighting, code completion, and error highlighting. Users will be able to write and edit code in real-time directly within the editor.

The backend of the real-time code editor will be built using Node.js, a powerful JavaScript runtime. Node.js allows developers to create scalable and efficient server-side applications. The backend will handle incoming client connections through Socket.IO and manage real-time collaboration between multiple users.

Socket.IO is a library that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between the client and the server over WebSockets. It establishes a persistent connection, enabling instant data exchange. The Socket.IO server will be integrated into the Node.js backend to facilitate real-time synchronization of code changes across connected clients.
