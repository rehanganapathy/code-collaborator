A real-time code editor enables users to collaboratively edit code online. Leveraging React, Node.js, and Socket.IO, developers can offer a unified coding experience. React, a renowned JavaScript library, powers the frontend. Its component-based design aids in crafting reusable UI components and efficiently managing application state. The editor, a pivotal frontend component, utilizes libraries like "CodeMirror" for a rich text editing experience, complete with syntax highlighting and error detection.

The backend, driven by Node.js, ensures scalability and efficiency. It processes client connections via Socket.IO, fostering collaboration among users. Socket.IO, pivotal for real-time, two-way communication, maintains a continuous connection for immediate data sharing. Integrated with the Node.js backend, it ensures synchronized code edits across clients.
